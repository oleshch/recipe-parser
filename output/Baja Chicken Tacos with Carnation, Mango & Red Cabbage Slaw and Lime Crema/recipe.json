   "description": "Carnations add a slight spicy and sweet flavour to dishes, which makes them a perfect addition to the ever-popular Mexican street food. These tacos are inspired by Baja cuisine, a fusion of Mexican and Mediterranean flavours. Centred in San Diego, Baja California, and other parts of Mexico, its menu is known for being fresh and flavourful. Carnation petals in the slaw and as garnish make this casual street food a little more sophisticated.",
