   "description": "This is a quick side dish to pull together just before serving, and it makes a nice change from traditional potatoes or pasta. It works well with the Brown-Ale-Braised Lamb Shanks and with poultry, beef or fish.",

   "recipeInstructions": [
      "Bring a large pot of water to a boil over high heat. Season liberally with salt.  2. Once water is at a full boil, combine oil, butter and garlic in a large skillet. Set pan over medium-low heat and gently heat until butter is melted and garlic is sizzling (do not let garlic brown).  3. In 2 batches, drop gnocchi into boiling water and cook for 2 to 3 minutes or just until they float to the surface. Use a sieve to scoop gnocchi out of water; shake off excess water and add directly to skillet with garlic.  4. Increase heat to medium-high and cook, shaking pan and lifting and turning gnocchi with a large spatula, for about 5 minutes or until gnocchi are slightly crispy and browned. Transfer to a large warmed serving bowl.  5. Add spinach and lemon juice to skillet. Stir for about 1 minute, just until wilted. Add to gnocchi, season with salt and pepper to taste and toss to combine."
