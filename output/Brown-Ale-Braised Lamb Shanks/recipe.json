   "description": "Unctuous isn\u2019t a word to throw around about a recipe without merit. These braised lamb shanks earn it in spades! Lots of liquid and a low-and-slow braise are the chef\u2019s techniques for falling off-the-bone lamb shanks\u2014don\u2019t attempt to rush it. The only trick to this recipe is hiding the extra lamb to make sure there are leftovers for the Brown Ale Lamb Poutine (recipe follows).",
   "recipeIngredient": [
      "8 lamb shanks, about 12 oz (340 g) each Salt and freshly ground pepper 2 tbsp (30 mL) canola oil, divided 2 onions, chopped 4 cloves garlic, minced 4 carrots, diced 2 stalks celery, diced 1/2 tsp (2 mL) dried rosemary, crumbled 1 can (473 mL) brown ale 4 cups (1 L) no-salt-added chicken broth 1/2 cup (125 mL) all-purpose flour 2/3 cup (150 mL) cold water or additional broth"

   "recipeInstructions": [
      "Preheat oven to 325\u00b0F (163\u00b0C).  2. Pat lamb shanks dry and season all over with salt and pepper. Heat 1 tbsp (15 mL) of the oil in a large Dutch oven or deep roasting pan over medium-high heat. Brown lamb shanks in batches of 2 or 3 (avoid crowding the pot), turning occasionally, for 8 to 10 minutes, until well-browned. Transfer to a large bowl as they\u2019re browned. Spoon off fat if too much accumulates as you cook (you only want a thin layer in the pot), and adjust heat as necessary to prevent burning. Pour off all the fat after browning lamb.  3. Reduce heat to medium-low. Add remaining oil to the pot. Add onions, garlic, carrots, celery, rosemary and 1/2 tsp (2 mL) each salt and pepper. Cook, stirring, for about 10 minutes or until vegetables are soft. Pour in ale and broth, and bring to a boil, scraping up browned bits stuck to the pot.  4. Return lamb shanks and any accumulated juices to the pot. Cover pot and transfer to oven. Braise for about 3 hours or until lamb is very tender.  5. Using a slotted spoon, transfer lamb shanks to a large bowl, cover with foil and keep warm. Skim fat from top of sauce. Bring sauce to a boil over medium heat. Whisk flour with cold water in a bowl until smooth. Gradually whisk into boiling sauce. Reduce heat and boil, whisking often, for about 10 minutes or until thickened. Season with salt and pepper to taste.  6. Reserve 2 lamb shanks and 2 cups (500 mL) of the sauce for Brown Ale Lamb Poutine; let cool and refrigerate in an airtight container for up to 3 days. Serve remaining lamb shanks with sauce."
