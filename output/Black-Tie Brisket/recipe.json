   "description": "The richness of long-cooked onions and sherry, along with the horseradish bite of the cheesy potato side dish (recipe follows), make this meal a grown-up and special-occasion-worthy take on the flavours of French onion soup. The brisket can be cooked the day before and rewarmed for easy and stress-free dinner prep.",
   "recipeIngredient": [

   "recipeInstructions": [
      "Preheat oven to 325\u00b0F (163\u00b0C).  2. Season brisket liberally with salt and pepper.  3. In a heavy-bottomed pot or roasting pan large enough to hold the brisket and vegetables, heat a film of oil until almost smoking. Reduce heat to medium, carefully place the brisket into the pot, and sear on all sides until well browned. Remove brisket and set aside.  4. Add onions to the pot and saut\u00e9 over medium heat, stirring and scraping any brown bits off the bottom of the pot with a wooden spoon, until softened and just beginning to brown, about 5 minutes. Stir in tomato paste to coat evenly, and cook for 2 minutes more.  5. Increase heat to high while continuing to stir. When onions begin to stick, stir in red wine and sherry to deglaze. Add beef broth and stir to combine.  6. Nestle in carrot, celery, garlic, rosemary, thyme and bay leaf, and return brisket to pot. Spoon some of the juices over brisket, cover pot loosely with foil, and cook in the oven for 2 hours.  7. Remove pot from oven and discard carrot, celery, rosemary, thyme and bay leaf. Carefully remove brisket to a cutting board and let rest until cool enough to slice about 10 minutes.  8. Using a sharp carving knife, slice brisket against the grain into 1-inch (2.5-cm) thick slices, then layer back in the pot with the onions. This will speed up the cooking process and allow the beef to soak up the rich onion juices.  9. Return to the oven and cook, uncovered, for 2 hours longer, spooning juices over the meat every 30 minutes. Remove from oven and let rest for 30 minutes.  10. Fan brisket slices on a serving dish. Keep warm.  11. Place pot with onions over medium heat and sprinkle flour over top. Simmer, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon, until sauce is thickened, about 5 minutes.  12. Pour onions over sliced brisket and serve with Horseradish & Gruy\u00e8re Roasted Fingerlings."
