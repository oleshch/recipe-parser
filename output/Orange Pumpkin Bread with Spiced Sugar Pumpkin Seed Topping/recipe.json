   "description": "It is hard to resist a slice of this spice-scented loaf that has all the flavours of pumpkin pie but is so much easier to bake. Use nutty roasted pumpkin seeds that resemble round pine nuts. Look for them in the bulk food section of supermarkets or health food stores. If unavailable, flat pumpkin seeds can also be used.",
