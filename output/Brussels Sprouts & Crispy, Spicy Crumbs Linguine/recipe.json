   "description": "Homemade pasta deserves an elegantly simple treatment. Here, toasted bread crumbs and chili flakes add a fiery flavour boost to a simple saut\u00e9 of caramelized Brussels sprouts and crisp pancetta. You\u2019ll find lots of bold, contrasting flavours and textures thanks to the bread crumbs and homemade pasta with the addition of lemon and fresh herbs. Our Umami Brodo with Parmesan & Porcini (recipe follows) makes an excellent starter to this meal.\u00a0",
   "recipeIngredient": [
      "3 tbsp (45 mL) olive oil",
      "3 tbsp (45 mL) butter",
      "2 tsp (10 mL) chili flakes",
      "4 garlic cloves, minced, divided",
      "1/2 cup (125 mL) panko bread crumbs",
      "1/4 lb (115 g) pancetta, cut into",
      "1/4-inch (5-mm) strips",
      "2 anchovies, patted dry and finely diced",
      "12 Brussels sprouts, thinly sliced",
      "1 lb (455 g) fresh linguine, made from Rich & Tender Homemade Pasta Dough (recipe follows)",
      "1 lemon, zested and juiced",
      "1 tbsp (15 mL) finely chopped basil"
   ],
   "recipeInstructions": [
      "Heat olive oil and butter in a large, wide frying pan. When frothy, stir to mix. Add chili flakes and half of garlic. Stir frequently until garlic softens slightly, about 1 minute. Add crumbs. Stir until toasted, about 3 to 5 minutes. Tilt the pan slightly and spoon bread crumb mixture into a bowl leaving excess oil in pan. Pour any excess oil into a separate small bowl and reserve.",
      "Bring a large pot of water to a boil.",
      "Meanwhile, add pancetta to the large frying pan. Set over medium heat. Cook until crisp, about 4 to 5 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, remove pancetta to a paper towel\u2013lined plate. Add remaining garlic and anchovies to pan. Stir until softened slightly, about 30 seconds. Add Brussels sprouts. Pour 1 tbsp (15 mL) remaining oil from bread crumb mixture overtop. Stir occasionally until softened and caramelized, 5 to 9 minutes. Taste and season with salt, if needed.",
      "Meanwhile, boil pasta until tender and floating up to the\u00a0 top of the water, 1 to 3 minutes. Carefully scoop 1 cup (250 mL) cooking water and set aside. Drain pasta. Turn pasta into pan with Brussels sprouts mixture. Stir in reserved pasta water until nicely coated. Taste and season with salt, if you like. Add pancetta. Divide between bowls. Squeeze lemon juice overtop. Sprinkle bread crumb mixture overtop. Garnish with basil and lemon zest."
