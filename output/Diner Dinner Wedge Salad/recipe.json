   "description": "Go full retro with creamy, zesty and pink (of course!) Thousand Island Dressing and a load of toppings on a crispy iceberg wedge. This version of the diner classic dressing is on the tangy side, which balances the rich toppings of bacon, egg and butter -toasted bread crumbs just right. And this is not the time to skimp on the dressing! A dense wedge of iceberg needs a good douse of dressing so use the whole batch for 4 servings. Add chicken or ham for a heartier main-course salad.\u00a0",

   "recipeInstructions": [
      "Melt butter in a small skillet over medium heat. Add bread crumbs and toast, stirring often, for about 5 minutes or until crumbs are golden and crisp. Transfer to a bowl and let cool.\u00a0",
      "Trim stem from lettuce and peel off loose outer leaves. Cut head vertically into quarters. Trim out the tough core, if desired, leaving a thin portion to keep the wedge intact (if the core isn\u2019t large you can leave it in). Arrange lettuce wedges with the rounded side down on serving plates.\u00a0",
      "Pour one-quarter of the dressing over each lettuce wedge. Scatter radishes, cucumber, tomatoes, bacon, eggs and chicken (if using) over top. Sprinkle with toasted bread crumbs and serve immediately.\u00a0"
