   "recipeInstructions": [
      "The day before cooking, rub lamb racks with olive oil, sprinkle with salt and pepper, and place in a container with garlic and rosemary, rubbing garlic and rosemary into the lamb. Store covered in the refrigerator until ready to cook.  2. Thirty minutes before cooking, remove the lamb from the refrigerator and allow it to sit at room temperature. This will ensure more even cooking.  3. Heat oven to 375\u00b0F (191\u00b0C).  4. Combine mustard with black truffle, and mix thoroughly. Set aside.  5. Combine bread crumbs, grated cheese, parsley and chives, and mix thoroughly. Set aside.  6. Heat a film of olive oil in an ovenproof saut\u00e9 pan. Sear lamb racks, fat side down, over medium-high heat until well browned, about 3 minutes. Flip to the other side and repeat.  7. Remove from pan. Brush lamb racks all over with mustard-truffle mixture, then press bread-crumb mixture on top of the lamb. Cover bones with a strip of aluminum foil to prevent burning and discolouring.  8. Return lamb to pan, and roast in the oven for 20 minutes, or until crust is evenly browned, and an internal temperature of 130\u00b0F (54\u00b0C) is reached.  9. Allow lamb racks to rest for 15 minutes. 10 Return to oven 2 minutes to rewarm, then slice and serve."
