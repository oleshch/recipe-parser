   "description": "Preservative-free scallops are sweeter and more flavourful than \u201cwet\u201d (aka \u201cpreserved\u201d) scallops and are the only kind you should eat raw. A good fishmonger should have these available\u2014ask for \u201cdry-pack\u201d scallops, and yes, it\u2019s totally ok to buy them frozen if that\u2019s what they\u2019ve got. They should be ivory-coloured instead of white, and, if fresh, sticky (not slippery) and smelling of the sea. Once you\u2019ve scored them you\u2019re done with the hard work. This beauty takes seconds to make and is perfect ice-cold-beer food. For the ginger juice, squeeze grated ginger between your fingertips over a measuring spoon\u2014keep the juice and discard the pulp.\u00a0",
