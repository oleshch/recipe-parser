   "description": "Switch and swap in your favourite seasonal greens or whatever looks best. The idea here is a light salad that is a stand-in for veggies and dip. Instead you have pretty whole-leaf greens for dipping in or drizzling with simple, tangy-sweet vinaigrette. It feels fancy because of the Champagne vinegar (although you can use white-wine vinegar) plus there are flowers!\u00a0",
