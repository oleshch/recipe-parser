   "description": "Boneless lamb neck is cheap, chewy and seriously good. Ask your butcher to bone the two flanks of meat on either side of the neck and to trim as much of the fat as possible. If all you\u2019ve got is the grocery store, use lamb chops. Thawed, previously frozen, imported lamb racks (just cut them into individual chops before grilling) are a good sub. Grill chops for 1 minute a side over a searing hot grill. There\u2019s enough sauce here for leftovers. Use in place of hummus to dress your favourite sandwich.",

   "recipeInstructions": [
      "For the peanut sauce, remove 1/2 cup (125 mL) liquid from a can of chickpeas, as well as 1/2 cup (125 mL) chickpeas. Add both to a blender (reserve remaining chickpeas and liquid for another use), along with peanut butter, olive oil, vinegar and garlic. Pur\u00e9e. Add cumin, allspice and paprika. Pulse to combine, then season with salt and pepper to taste. Scrape into a small bowl, cover and refrigerate for up to 3 days (return to room temperature before use).  2. Preheat grill to high heat.  3. Add cucumbers to a colander set in the sink. Toss with 1/2 tsp (2 mL) salt and sugar. Let stand while cooking lamb.  4. Cut lamb into 2 equal-size pieces. Season generously with salt and pepper. Grill for 6 minutes per side for medium, rotating occasionally to form an even crust. Remove to a plate and tent with foil. Let rest for 10 minutes.  5. When ready to serve, tip cucumbers into a small bowl and toss with vinegar; check seasoning and add more salt if necessary. Spoon about half of the peanut sauce over the bottom of a platter (reserve the rest for another use). Carve lamb against the grain into 1/4-inch (5-mm) thick slices. Arrange over the sauce and arrange cucumbers over and around the lamb. Sprinkle with sesame seeds. Serve hot."
