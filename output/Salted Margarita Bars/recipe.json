   "description": "When making these bars, the base finishes baking right around the same time the curd comes together. If the curd is ready before the base or vice versa, either can be set aside at room temperature until you\u2019re ready to move on to the next step. Straining the curd is key for a super silky texture.",

   "recipeInstructions": [
      "Position rack in bottom third of the oven. Preheat to 350\u00b0F (177\u00b0C). Generously butter a 9-inch (23-cm) square baking dish. Line bottom with parchment with overhanging edges on two opposing sides.  2. For the base, combine flour, sugar, salt and lime zest in the bowl of a food processor. Add butter and pulse until butter is the size of peas. Add egg yolk and continue blending until a crumbly dough just comes together, up to 1 minute. Turn out into a prepared pan and press into an even layer. Bake in the bottom third of the oven until golden, about 30 minutes. Set aside.  3. While the crust is baking, make the curd. Whisk eggs, yolks, sugar, lime juice, tequila, orange juice, lime zest and orange zest in a medium saucepan until fully combined. Set over medium-high heat and cook, stirring constantly with a silicone spatula, until thickened, 6 to 8 minutes. Curd will just be pulling away from the bottom of the pan when stirred. Remove from heat. Add butter and stir occasionally until fully combined, 2 to 3 minutes. Using a fine-mesh sieve, strain the mixture into a clean bowl. Scrape curd into prepared crust, smoothing top.  4. Reduce oven to 300\u00b0F (149\u00b0C).  5. Once the oven has fully reduced in temperature, bake in the bottom third until the curd has set around the edges but still wobbles slightly, 12 to 14 minutes. Cool on a wire rack for 1 hour, then refrigerate, uncovered, for at least 2 hours or overnight.  6. To serve, lift bars out of the pan and cut into 16 bars, wiping knife clean in between cuts. When ready to serve, sprinkle bars with lime zest and flaky sea salt. (Ungarnished bars will keep in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 3 days.)"
