   "description": "Slow and low is the best method to coax out the giving, unctuous texture of a shank. This recipe is a labour of love, taking about eight hours to cook, but the results are worth it.",

   "recipeInstructions": [
      "To make coffee rub, mix together kosher salt, instant coffee, garlic powder, onion powder, black pepper, paprika, coriander, chilli powder and cayenne. Store in an airtight container until ready to use.",
      "The day before cooking, using enough rub to cover the entire surface area of the meat, liberally sprinkle coffee rub on the beef shank. Reserve any remaining rub for another use. Cover and refrigerate overnight.",
      "The next morning, preheat barbecue to high heat. Turn off 1 element and reduce others to medium-low.",
      "Place beef shank on the unheated side and close lid. The temperature should be about 325\u00b0F (163\u00b0C). Allow to cool for 4 hours.",
      "Meanwhile, whisk together coffee, Dijon mustard, balsamic vinegar, oil, ketchup and Tabasco. This will be used to baste the shank for the remaining cooking time, keeping it moist and reinforcing the coffee flavour in the rub.",
      "After 4 hours, open the lid and brush the shank all over with basting liquid. Repeat every 30 minutes until an internal temperature of 195\u00b0F (91\u00b0C) is reached, about 4 hours more.",
      "Allow to rest for 20 minutes, then carve into slices and serve."
