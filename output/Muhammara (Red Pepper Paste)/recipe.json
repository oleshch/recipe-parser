   "description": "Traditionally made with peppers, walnuts and spices, this vibrant dip comes in many forms throughout countries in the Levant. It is traditionally presented in a meze platter, but at Simit & Chai Co., muhammara is served as a spread for simit. Also, try complementing the pepper paste with sliced avocado or cucumber.",

      "Preheat oven to broil.  2. Place red pepper on a baking sheet on the upper rack of the oven. Char skin of pepper on all sides, rotating pepper every few minutes, about 10 minutes.  3. Place red pepper in a bowl and cover with plastic. Once cool enough to handle, remove and discard skin and seeds.  4. Reduce oven temperature to 350\u2011F (177\u2011C).  5. Place walnuts on a baking sheet and toast, shaking the pan halfway through, until golden brown and fragrant, about 5 minutes.  6. Add toasted walnuts, red pepper flesh, bread crumbs, 4 tbsp (60 mL) olive oil, pomegranate molasses, red pepper flakes and lemon juice to a blender. Pulse until smooth paste forms. Add more olive oil if necessary to achieve a paste-like consistency.  7. Season with salt. Add more pepper flakes if you prefer it spicier."
