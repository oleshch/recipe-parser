   "recipeInstructions": [
      "The day before, place pepper, mustard, lemon zest, shallot, herbs, Worcestershire sauce and canola oil in a blender and process until a smooth paste is formed.  2. Rub the paste all over the lamb shoulder, and season inside and out with salt. Tie with butcher\u2019s twine. Cover and store refrigerated overnight.  3. To make the glaze, place Guinness, treacle and malt vinegar in a heavy-bottom saucepan. Stir to combine, then bring to a simmer over medium-high heat and reduce by approximately 75 percent, until quite thick and sticky. Allow to cool and store, covered, until ready to use.  4. Thirty minutes before roasting lamb, remove it from the fridge and allow it to sit at room temperature. This will ensure more even cooking.  5. Preheat oven to 450\u00b0F (232\u00b0C).  6. In a roasting pan or on a baking tray lined with a wire rack, place lamb shoulder in the oven and cook for 5 minutes. Reduce heat to 300\u00b0F (149\u00b0C).  7. After 25 minutes, remove the lamb from the oven and brush with glaze all over. Repeat this process three more times at 15-minute intervals.  8. Continue to roast lamb until the meat reaches an internal temperature of 140\u00b0F (60\u00b0C), about 45 minutes.  9. Glaze once more, loosely tent with aluminum foil, and allow to rest for 25 minutes.  10. Slice and serve."
