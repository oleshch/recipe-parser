   "description": "A bowl of this glorious autumn-hued soup is an impressive way to kick off any fall dinner. Parsnips are the secret ingredient in the best chicken soups, and they play a similar role here, lending nuanced flavour.",
   "recipeIngredient": [
      "1 large butternut squash, about 2 1/2 lbs (1.13 kg) 1 tbsp (15 mL) olive oil 3 parsnips, about 10 oz (285 g) total 4 cups (1 L) chicken broth (approx.), divided 1/2 tsp (2 mL) dried leaf thyme, crumbled 1/2 tsp (2 mL) salt Stilton Toasts (recipe follows)"

   "recipeInstructions": [
      "Preheat oven to 375\u00ad\u00b0F (191\u00ad\u00b0C).  2. Slice squash in quarters lengthwise. Place on a baking sheet. Scrape out and discard pulp and seeds. Rub cut surfaces with oil. Trim and peel parsnips. Slice in half lengthwise. Rub with oil. Tightly wrap in foil. Set beside squash. Roast for 1 hour.  3. Slice any dark brown areas from parsnips and discard. Place parsnips and 1/2 cup (125 mL) broth in a food processor. Whirl until coarsely pur\u00e9ed. Remove skin and any dark areas from squash. Add squash, thyme, salt and another 1/2 cup (125 mL) broth to the food processor. Pulse, then whirl until as smooth as you like. Whirl in as much remaining broth as the container will hold.  4. Turn into a saucepan and stir in any remaining broth. If soup is thicker than you like, thin with more broth or water. Taste and add salt, if needed. Heat and serve with Stilton Toasts, either floating them on the soup or serving them on the side. Soup can be refrigerated for 3 days or frozen."
