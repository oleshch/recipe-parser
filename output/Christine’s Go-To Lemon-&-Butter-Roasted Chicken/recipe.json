   "description": "\u201cI like using fennel because I love how it breaks down and caramelizes with the potatoes,\u201d says chef Christine Mast. In the fall her thoughts turn to turnips and carrots, but this recipe is so versatile, she says to just open your crisper drawer and use what you\u2019ve got. But don\u2019t forget to squeeze the roasted lemons into the pan juices: \u201cThat pop of acidity is a huge part of this.\u201d If you can\u2019t find Diamond Crystal salt, substitute half the amount of table or fine sea salt.",

   "recipeInstructions": [
      "Preheat oven to 350\u00b0F (177\u00b0C).  2. Bring the chicken out of the fridge and allow it to sit on the counter at room temperature while prepping the rest of the recipe. This will help you rub the butter onto the chicken without clumping later.  3. In a small bowl, combine butter with 1 tbsp (15 mL) of thyme, oregano, lemon zest, 1/2 tsp (2 mL) salt, 1/4 tsp (1 mL) black pepper and the grated garlic. Stir to combine.  4. Toss fennel, potatoes, shallots, remaining garlic and 1 tbsp (15 mL) of thyme with 1 tbsp (15 mL) of olive oil, 1/4 tsp (1 mL) black pepper and 1/2 tsp (2 mL) salt. Toss together and place in the bottom of a heavy-bottomed roasting pan.  5. Gently lift the chicken skin from the meat of the breasts by placing your fingers between the skin and the meat. Move around and separate the membrane that attaches the skin from the breasts, as well as around the thighs and drumsticks. Then take three-quarters of the butter mixture and spread generously between the skin and the meat.  6. Season the outside of the chicken with the remaining 1 tbsp (15 mL) of olive oil and 1/2 tsp (2 mL) salt. Stuff lemon halves into the chicken cavity, then tie the legs together with kitchen string. Spread the remaining butter mixture all over the skin, especially the breast.  7. Place chicken on prepared potatoes and fennel, and roast in the oven for about 1 hour. Then remove the roasting pan from the oven and turn up the heat to 375\u00b0F (191\u00b0C).  8. Tilt the pan and gently baste the chicken with the juices. Move around potatoes, shallots and fennel to ensure even browning. Return pan to oven. Roast until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the inner thigh near the breast without touching the bone reaches 165\u00b0F (74\u00b0C), another 30 to 40 minutes. (Rotate pan a few times to ensure even crisping and browning.) Rest for 20 minutes. (Note: If using a convection oven, roast 40 to 50 minutes at 350\u00b0F/177\u00b0C, then 25 to 30 minutes at 375\u00b0F/191\u00b0C.)  9. Squeeze all the juice from the roasted lemon into the pan, then spoon the roasting liquid over everything. Carve chicken and serve with roasted fennel and potatoes."
