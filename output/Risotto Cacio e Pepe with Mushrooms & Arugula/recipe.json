   "description": "It seems a natural fit to bring together the creaminess of risotto with the flavour profile of cacio e pepe, a match made in heaven. The starch released by the risotto rice enhances the creaminess of this dish. The toasted peppercorns and fresh arugula balance the dish with their peppery fresh bite.\u00a0",

   "recipeInstructions": [
      "Heat a medium saucepan over high heat. Add peppercorns. Toast them, swirling the pan occasionally until the peppercorns begin to wiggle and pop, about 1 minute. Remove from heat. Let cool. Crush the peppercorns to a coarse texture using a mortar and pestle or the back of a knife. Reserve.",
      "Chop mushrooms into \u00bd-inch (1-cm) pieces. If using shiitake, discard the stem. Heat a large, wide saut\u00e9 pan over high heat. Add mushrooms and cook in a dry pan until all the moisture has evaporated. Remove from heat and sprinkle with salt. Transfer to a plate and reserve. Wipe pan clean.",
      "Return pan to stove over medium heat. Add oil. Add garlic and shallots and cook until softened, about 1 minute. Add rice and stir until evenly coated with oil. Add wine and cook until the wine has evaporated.",
      "Add \u00bd cup (125 mL) warm chicken stock to the rice and stir constantly until it has been absorbed. Repeat, adding liquid by the \u00bd\u0161cup (125\u0161mL) and stirring each time until absorbed, until rice is tender and al dente, about 20 minutes. Remove from heat. Stir in cheeses then mushrooms, arugula and all but 1 tsp (5 mL) reserved pepper. Divide between plates and top with more cheese and remaining pepper\u00a0"
