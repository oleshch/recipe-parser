      "Finely chop 6 strips of bacon and place in a medium nonstick frying pan over medium-high heat. Cook, stirring occasionally, until brown and crisp, about 10 minutes. Remove bacon with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towel. (Save rendered fat in the fridge or freezer for another use.) When the cornbread batter (recipe follows) is about half mixed, sprinkle in bacon and 1/2 cup (125 mL) finely sliced chives. Mix until bacon and chives are evenly distributed and batter is just combined. This will take approximately 5 minutes longer to bake than plain cornbread, about 50 to 55 minutes in total."
