   "description": "A verdant spin on a Middle Eastern favourite, this fresh, crunchy salad finds raw and barely cooked veggies with fistfuls of herbs in a lemony dressing. All the elements of the salad can be prepared up to one day in advance, but only dress it at the last minute to preserve the bright green colours.",
