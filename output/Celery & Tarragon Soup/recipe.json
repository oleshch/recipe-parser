   "description": "We kept this simple Italian-inspired soup on the light side so you can comfortably serve it before a multi-course meal, but don\u2019t skip the topping! The dates may seem a bit strange until you realize it\u2019s essentially a grown-up version of ants on a log.",

      "Heat a Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add oil, then celery, leeks, garlic and salt.

Meanwhile, to make the topping, combine oil, almonds, Parmesan and dates in a small bowl.  4. Working in batches, transfer soup to a blender and pur\u00e9e until smooth. Return to pot. Warm over medium heat, about 2 minutes. To serve, scatter with topping and garnish with celery leaves."
