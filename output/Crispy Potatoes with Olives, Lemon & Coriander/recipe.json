   "description": "This quick Cypriot dish brings punchy flavours to roast potatoes: garlic, olives and cracked coriander seeds, which lend a citrusy note. A splash of lemon juice and its zest brighten the dish and cut through the starch.",

      "2 tbsp (30 mL) whole coriander seeds",
      "1/4 cup (60 mL) light olive oil",

   "recipeInstructions": [
      "In a large pot, add potatoes and enough water to cover. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat to simmer. Cook until potatoes are fork-tender, 6 to 7 minutes. Drain and transfer to a baking sheet. When potatoes are cool enough to handle, cut in half lengthwise.",
      "Place coriander in mortar and press with pestle to crack. You can also place it between two pieces of parchment and press down with bottom of heavy skillet.",
      "In a large saut\u00e9 pan, heat oil over medium heat. Add garlic. Cook until soft and translucent, 3 to 4 minutes. Transfer garlic with a slotted spoon to a small plate. Set aside.",
      "Add potatoes to hot oil. Cook, turning occasionally, 5 minutes. Add cracked coriander, garlic, olives and lemon zest. Cook, stirring occasionally, until potatoes are crisp and golden, about 5 minutes more.",
      "Remove from heat and stir in lemon juice and salt."
