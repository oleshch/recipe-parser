   "description": "If you\u2019ve never tried adobo before, now\u2019s your big chance. The sauce couldn\u2019t be easier and packs such an amazing flavour punch that it\u2019ll instantly become your new favourite gravy. Halving a chicken is easy if you have poultry shears; otherwise, ask your butcher to do it for you.",
   "recipeIngredient": [
      "3 1/2- to 4-lb (1.585- to 1.81-kg) whole air-chilled chicken 1 tbsp (15 mL) olive oil Salt and ground black pepper to taste 1 tsp (5 mL) whole peppercorns 2 bay leaves 4 cloves garlic, peeled and crushed 1/2 cup (125 mL) water, divided 2 tbsp (30 mL) soy sauce 2 tbsp (30 mL) apple cider vinegar 1 tbsp (15 mL) cornstarch"

   "recipeInstructions": [
      "Preheat oven to 400\u00b0F (204\u00b0C).  2. On a cutting board, place chicken breast side down with legs facing you. Using poultry shears, cut through each side of the backbone from cavity end to neck. Remove the backbone and set it aside. Flatten chicken with your hand and cut chicken in half along the breastbone. Pat dry with a paper towel, making sure skin is thoroughly dry.  3. Rub oil evenly over chicken skin and season with salt and pepper. Place chicken halves, skin-side up, as well as the backbone, in a roasting pan. Roast until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the inner thigh near the breast without touching the bone reaches 145\u00b0F (63\u00b0C), about 30 minutes. Remove from oven.  4. Set oven to low broil. Broil chicken on the middle rack until golden brown, 6 to 8 minutes. The broiling and resting period will bring the internal temperature to 165\u00b0F (74\u00b0C).  5. Remove roasting pan from oven. Remove chicken halves from the pan. Set aside and let rest while making the sauce.  6. Set the roasting pan with the backbone on the stovetop over medium heat and add peppercorns, bay leaves and garlic. Saut\u00e9 for 1 minute, then deglaze the pan with 1/4 cup (60 mL) of water, soy sauce and apple cider vinegar. Bring to a simmer and cook for 2 to 3 minutes.  7. In a small bowl, create a slurry with cornstarch and remaining water, stirring until smooth. Stir cornstarch slurry into pan sauce and allow to thicken for another 2 minutes. Strain through a sieve and serve adobo pan sauce with the rested roast chicken."
