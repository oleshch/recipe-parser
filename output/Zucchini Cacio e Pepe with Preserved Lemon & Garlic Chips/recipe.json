   "description": "It wouldn\u2019t be fair to reserve cacio e pepe only for carb lovers\u2014so here\u2019s a version using spiralized zucchini with crispy garlic and preserved lemon. Spiralizers have become a relatively common kitchen gadget and are great for zucchini, sweet potatoes, squash and more. If you don\u2019t have one, spiralized vegetables are now readily available in most grocery stores.\u00a0",

   "recipeInstructions": [
      "Heat a medium saucepan over high heat. Add peppercorns. Toast, swirling the pan occasionally until the peppercorns begin to wiggle and pop, about 1 minute. Remove from heat. Let cool. Crush the peppercorns to a coarse texture using a mortar and pestle or the back of a knife. Reserve.",
      "Add grated cheeses to a large, wide bowl. Stir in \u00bc cup (60 mL) room-temperature water. Using a spatula, stir the cheese and water together, lightly pressing down with the back of the spatula to form a paste. Set mixture aside.",
      "Melt butter with oil in a wide saucepan over medium heat. Add garlic and cook, stirring, until slices turn light golden, about 2 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon to a paper- towel-lined plate. Pour melted butter and oil into a\u2013small dish to cool.",
      "Return same saucepan to stove and increase to medium-high. Add zucchini spirals and cook, tossing occasionally, until just tender, 3 to 4 minutes. Drain zucchini to remove any excess moisture.",
      "Stir cooled melted butter and oil into cheese mixture. Add zucchini, pepper and preserved lemon. Toss together. The cheese will not fully melt; this is okay. Divide between plates and sprinkle with garlic chips."
