   "description": "For this no-cream, creamy pasta sauce we\u2019ve used pumpkin seed butter, though other smooth seed or nut butters such as sunflower, cashew, hazelnut or almond butter work well, too. If you prefer a stuffed pasta, use a 250-g package of fresh or frozen ravioli instead of the fettuccine. Baby kale can sub in for the spinach for a sharper taste. This recipe can easily be doubled for four servings.\u00a0",
