   "recipeIngredient": [
      "Canola oil for brushing",
      "1 lb (455 g) ripe plum tomatoes",
      "2 tbsp (30 mL) red wine vinegar",
      "1 large garlic clove, grated on rasp",
      "1/4 cup (60 mL) extra virgin olive oil",
      "Salt and freshly ground pepper to taste",
      "1 lb (455 g) dried spaghetti, preferably Italian",
      "1/3 cup (80 mL) chopped basil",
      "Finely grated Parmigiano-Reggiano for serving",
      "Small basil sprigs to garnish"
   ],
   "recipeInstructions": [
      "To make salsa rossa, place top oven rack in highest position and preheat broiler on high. Line a heavy-duty baking sheet with foil. Brush foil lightly with canola oil.",
      "2. Halve tomatoes lengthwise. Scoop out seeds and discard (or save for vegetable stock). Place tomatoes on prepared sheet. Brush with canola oil and arrange cut side up. Broil on top rack until lightly charred, 6 to 7 minutes. Flip and broil until skins are charred, about 2 minutes. Remove from oven. Cool until tepid.",
      "3. Remove and discard skins. Transfer tomatoes and any juices to a food processor and add vinegar and garlic. Pulse until it forms a coarse pur\u00e9e. With motor running, slowly add olive oil until combined. Season with salt and pepper. Transfer to an airtight container. Refrigerate salsa rossa up to 5 days.",
      "4. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti according to instructions on package. Drain. Rinse with cold running water until pasta has cooled. Drain again. Transfer to a large mixing bowl and blot excess moisture with paper towel.",
      "5. Pour salsa rossa over pasta and add chopped basil. Season with salt and pepper. Mix thoroughly with tongs. Serve mounded in small bowls topped with Parmigiano-Reggiano and basil sprigs. (Note: If you have leftovers, you might need to add a splash of red wine vinegar before serving, since starch tends to temper acidity over time.)"
