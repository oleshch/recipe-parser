   "description": "Prep ahead for those nights when you don\u2019t have much time for dinner but need to eat a decent meal. You can grill the chicken ahead and/or make the salad ahead. When you have a little more time, you can cook and enjoy it right away, plus it\u2019s easy to double if you want leftovers as well (dinner and lunch in one? Yes, please!). Sliced cucumbers and tomatoes on the side complete the meal.",
